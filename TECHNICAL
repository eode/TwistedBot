PLAYER BODY
Affected by it's bounding box (BB) overlap with blocks.


Ladders and vines have same speed, jumping and falling effect
effect area is if bottom center of legs is in ladder/vine block
unattached vine has a effect area which slightly overlaps to the empthy block (where it would otherwise attached to the wall)

LADDER
body lower has to be in ladder block to climb
ladder blocks has to be continuous, although not directly above (can be diagonal)
if ladder in upper body, can jump so the lower body would be in ladder block
can climb/descend on any solid block face (not just ladder it self), probably also in the whole block
ladder can exist only as attached to block on side, therefore no need to check surrounding blocks
has collision bb


VINE
similar to ladder with these differences:
no collision bb
can exist without being attached to block side (by growing)
if exists without side block, player can only descend
